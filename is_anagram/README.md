# Problem 2: Is Anagram?

Given two strings `s` and `t`, return `true` if `t` is an anagram of `s`, and `false` otherwise.

An anagram is a word or phrase formed by rearranging the letters of a different word or phrase, typically using all the original letters exactly once.

## Example:

```
Input: s = "anagram", t = "nagaram"
Output: true
```
