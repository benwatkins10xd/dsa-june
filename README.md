1) Two sum - arrays and maps
2) Valid anagram - arrays and maps
3) Binary search - arrays and searching

Remember:
- The goal is to get working code
- Avoid premature optimisations - if your code doesn't run then there's no point optimising it!
- Try not to cheat; all solutions are here
- When you have a working first solution, then you can start to consider optimising!
